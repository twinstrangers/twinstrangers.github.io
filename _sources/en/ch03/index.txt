When you find a user that you want to ban (it will actually lock their account).
Just click on the lock on the right.

On the edit user form you will have a Destroy User button that do so.

A confirmation dialog will then appear to confirm the change.

.. note::
    If you delete an account, the user's informations will be destroyed from the database.
    That means their is no way to retrieve it. You should rather use the locking option when a user violate the terms so that they cannot recreate an account.
